# Speedcubing Canada Major Championship Reimbursement Transfer Policy

Uses of the words “must”, “must not”, “should”, “should not” and “may” match [RFC 2119](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt).

All dollar amounts discussed are in Canadian dollars.

Speedcubing Canada’s Board of Directors reserves the right to modify this document with a majority of not less than two-thirds (2/3) of Speedcubing Canada’s Board of Directors vote in favour of the modification.

This document extends the [Speedcubing Canada Reimbursement Policy](https://www.speedcubingcanada.org/documents/reimbursement-policy.pdf).

## Introduction and Purpose

For major championships that are Speedcubing Canada Supported Events (e.g., Canadian Championship, North American Championship, a provincial championship, or other regional championship; the precise definition is at the discretion of Speedcubing Canada’s Board of Directors), Speedcubing Canada may budget a fixed maximum-allowed reimbursement amount for WCA Delegates, competition organizers, Speedcubing Canada Officers, and/or Speedcubing Canada Directors (henceforth referred to as a “special reimbursed individual”) to travel to the championship. This policy allows for a special reimbursed individual to transfer all or part of their budgeted reimbursement amount from one championship to another.

All requirements set out in the Speedcubing Canada Reimbursement Policy **must** be followed with the following additions and exception explained under the “Allowed Transfer Window” and “Submitting Allowed Expenses” sections.

## Allowed Transfer Window

- A special reimbursed individual may transfer their budgeted reimbursement amount for a current championship for a past championship up to two years in the past or for a future championship up to two years in the future.
  - A current championship is defined as the championship that the budgeted reimbursement amount is being transferred from. The championship **must** be a Speedcubing Canada Supported Event.
  - A past championship is defined as having its first day of competition on or after January 1 of the calendar year two years before the current championship and its last day of competition on or before the first day of competition of the current championship. The championship **must** be a Speedcubing Canada Supported Event.
  - A future championship is defined as having its last day of competition on or before December 31 of the calendar year two years after the current championship and its first day of competition after the first day of competition of the current championship. The championship **must** be a Speedcubing Canada Supported Event.
  - If transferring to a past championship, the reimbursement request **must** be submitted within 365 days of the end of the current championship (this supersedes the Speedcubing Canada Reimbursement Policy).
    - Reimbursements submitted between 61 and 365 days of when the out-of-pocket payment was made *should not* include a written explanation for the delay (this supersedes the Speedcubing Canada Reimbursement Policy).
  - If transferring to a future championship, the reimbursement request **must** be submitted within the window required by the Speedcubing Canada Reimbursement Policy.  

## Submitting Allowed Expenses

- The reimbursement request **must** indicate that it is covered by the Major Championship Reimbursement Transfer.
- The reimbursement request **must** list the past championship or future championship that the budgeted reimbursement amount is being transferred to as the associated Speedcubing Canada Supported Event
- The reimbursement request _should_ mention the current championship that the budgeted reimbursement amount is being transferred from.

## Examples

- For a Canadian Championship held in Vancouver, British Columbia on August 3 to 5, 2029, the WCA Delegates from Vancouver would likely not have any travel expenses. Thus, the WCA Delegates from Vancouver would be eligible to transfer full their budgeted reimbursement amount to a major championship supported by Speedcubing Canada in the following window: starting on or after January 1, 2027 and ending on or before December 31, 2031. In this case, the WCA Delegates may elect to transfer to a North American Championship held in Toronto, Ontario on June 22 to 25, 2028.
- For a Canadian Championship held in Ottawa, Ontario, the WCA Delegates from Toronto, Ontario would likely have minimal travel expenses. If the budgeted reimbursement amount was \$300 and they reimbursed \$70 for the championship in Ottawa, they would have \$230 available to transfer to a past championship or future championship.
- For a Canadian Championship held on July 8 to 11, 2027, if a special reimbursed individual requested to transfer their budgeted reimbursement amount to a North American Championship held on June 13 to 15, 2024, the transferred reimbursement request would **not** be accepted since it is outside the two-year allowed transfer window.
- For a Canadian Championship held in 2027, if a special reimbursed individual has no expenses and plans to transfer their 2027 budgeted reimbursement amount to a Canadian Championship held in 2029, then has no expenses again in 2029, they would **not** be allowed to transfer the 2027 budgeted reimbursement amount to a Canadian Championship held in 2031 since it is outside the two-year allowed transfer window (however, they would be allow to transfer a 2029 budgeted reimbursement amount to 2031).
