# Speedcubing Canada Reimbursement Policy

Uses of the words “must”, “must not”, “should”, “should not” and “may” match [RFC 2119](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt).

All dollar amounts discussed are in Canadian dollars.

Whenever feasible, Speedcubing Canada _should_ transact directly with venues, vendors, merchants and service providers to avoid the need to reimburse individual(s) and/or group(s). When reimbursement is necessary, this policy describes allowed expenses and the process for the submission, approval and payment of approved reimbursements.

Individual(s) and/or group(s) _should not_ expect reimbursement from Speedcubing Canada, even if the expense is covered by the policies described in this document. If individual(s) and/or group(s) are planning to request reimbursement for allowed expenses, they _should_ discuss the expense with Speedcubing Canada’s Board of Directors prior to making any out-of-pocket payment(s).

Speedcubing Canada’s Board of Directors reserves the right to modify this document (including the addition or removal of allowed expenses) with a majority of not less than two-thirds (2/3) of Speedcubing Canada’s Board of Directors vote in favour of the modification.
